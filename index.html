      Hi, I'm Kevin.  I've worjed in the graphics media industry for almost five years now.  Since the college days I was always aware the the "scary" world of computer coding existed but sadly did not explore it much, partly because a bunch of code on a screen looks entimidating and I was alredy enjoying what I was studying so...eh.

    <div class="text2">
      But oh what a mistake...coding skill are so essential now!.  So here I am now trying to learn some code and other similar skills that will help me level up on my industry.  So it's gonna be a couple of exciting months and hope to have fun along the way.
